1. Feature Definition
Start by defining what your app should offer. Example core features:

Dashboard overview: total balance, loans due, rents due, investments

Reporting: monthly income vs. expense, loan trends, rent collection

Reminders/alerts for due dates (loans, rent)

Search/filtering on all entities

User roles: e.g. admin vs regular user (for multi-user support)
